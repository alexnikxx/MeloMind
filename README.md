## MeloMind

### Overview
The MeloMind app aims to teach children to meditate after intellectual activity or experiencing complex emotions. This project was made to participate in the Swift Student Challenge.

### Description
Over the past couple of years, I've encountered many broken adults who are doing their best to heal through therapy, meditation, yoga, and other methods. They didn't come to this decision quickly or easily, as there is still an incomplete level of approval and understanding of such tools in our society. Unfortunately, many amazing people are held back by self-doubt, fear of making mistakes or losing control, all because of negative experiences from the past that they haven't been able to resolve.

This frightening statistic led me to think about creating an introductory game using SwiftUI that would help children learn about a possible way to help themselves. The child needs a friend. The application uses a charming character Melo, acting in this role. He engages children in a fun competition before encouraging them to take a few deep breaths to relax. The child learns to calm down after intellectual activity and also analyzes their emotions outside of it. In the game, they are praised, sympathized with, and given attention. Perhaps it would be much easier for all of us if we were taught from childhood how to deal with our pain so that we could leave it behind or continue to move forward while living with it.
